# AnimeDB

This project was built with React, React-Router, Reactstrap, Express, Node, and MongoDB. The objective was to create a personalized list of the user's favorite animes and be able to like, rate, review, and post about them to social media. The landing page would list the Top 50 animes, with options to look through most recently updated or alphabetically. This project utilized the [Jikan API (Unofficial MyAnimeList API)](https://jikan.moe/).

## Future Improvements

- [] Reduce load time.
- [] Get away from Reactstrap and use CSS Grid or Flexbox instead.
- [] Host on Heroku, DigitalOcean, or Netlify
